## Welcome to the page of the next big thing in the beverage industry


Our objective is to make autonomous household robots less wide and more vertical. With control capabilities that allow us to balance vertically structured robots on two wheels, we are capable of achieving tasks with less space on the ground.

Sodabot is the first iterration towards the realization of that task. With its unique vertical structure, it can house a can of cold refreshing beverage to be delivered to the comfort of your couch !

Now, even skipping the halftime commercials is no longer necessary. The reason ? Sodabot !
